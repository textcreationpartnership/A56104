            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough this small Book has the Ill-fortune to come abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World at such a Time, when by the Licentiousness of an unlicensed Press, the Town is pester'd with such a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous swarm of idle Pamphlets, as made the most Knowing and Judicious too apt to censure all Books, without perusing them; judging (though too severely) that all are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that pains, because most are: Yet this doth not much discourage the Author, nor make him doubt of a kinde reception from all true <hi>English Protestants;</hi> since that which is the Subject of this Piece, <hi>viz.</hi> the Plot, was designed to involve all such in a general Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And certainly, it cannot but be acceptable to us,
<pb facs="tcp:50476:3"/> to take a view of the greatness of the Danger we so luckily escaped. No true Protestant, I am sure, doubts the reality of this lately-discovered New Branch of the Old Plot, which hath been carried on and continued ever since our <hi>Reformation,</hi> though in differing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, by these cursed <hi>Janizaries</hi> of Hell and <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> who for complicated Mischiefs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-unheard-of Villanies, make the Devil himself stand in admiration, to see himself outdone in his own Trade by these Devils incarnate: And blame me not for giving them this Character, unless it be because I have not said enough (for words are too weak and low to give them their due.) But alas, poor Innocents! How unchristian, nay inhumane and barbarous, are these <hi>English</hi> Hereticks, to scandalize them after such a rate as they do? Poor Souls! (cry they) all that we seek by our Prayers and Pains, is your Conversion and Salvation, to bring you out of your damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Heresies, and lead you the right way to Paradise. A likely matter I Indeed, if cutting our Throats, burning and destroying our Habitations, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating and corrupting our Wives and Daughters, and cheating us of our Goods, Money and Estates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring to Murder our Dread Sovereign Lord the Kings most Gracious Majesty, and to solemnize his Obsequies with the Death and Destruction of us all; if this be the way to convert us, from such Conversion, <hi>Libera nos Domine.</hi> What could we expect worse at the hands of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> nay the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Savages, than these infernal Monsters designed to inflict upon all in general, that would not truckle to their Superstition and Idolatry? But
<q>Ludit in humanis Divina Potentia rebus.</q>
               <pb facs="tcp:50476:3"/> God saw their Designes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd though he suffered them to go on for a while, yet he was seen in the Mount (as he hath graciously promised he would be, in his most holy Word:) just when implacable Malice stood with its Arm extended, preparing to strike the fatal stroak, and destroy us all at one blow, the most Just God, who hath said, Vengeance is his, turn'd it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and they are fallen into the Pit which they digged for our Destruction.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all that they have done, and though concerning Villany they may do as <hi>Hercules</hi> did concerning the utmost bounds of the World, write a <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> when they leave off their Old Trade, (which will never be without Squire <hi>Ketch's</hi> assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:) Yet some good, honest, plain-meaning people think it is no such matter, as if it were impossible that Men of such Learning, Gravity, and seeming Piety and Sanctity, should be such abominable Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Poor deluded Souls! the Devil himself may learn of them to dissemble, and cannot so easily appear an Angel of Light, as these can seeming Saints.</p>
            <p>Let their Proselytes say what they will of their Conversion, and with a blind Implicite Faith believe themselves real Converts; yet I never read that they Converted any but two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> An Honest Man to a Knave, or at best Fool, and a Wife or Virgin to a Whore. And if the same Law were in force against them here, which is in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Territories, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should be Guelt, when and wherever they happen to be taken; I believe then we should be less plagued with these Caterpillars, though they would never cease to Plot our Destruction.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, this small Book presents itself
<pb facs="tcp:50476:4"/> to thee; and if you reap by it either Pleasure or Profit, the Authour hath his Designe; who was desirous (if it be this Poems fate to survive this present Age) that Posterity might take a short view of their Treachery, and learn to beware, having so subtle an Enemy to deal with.</p>
            <p>The Book, as to Matter and Method, I freely leave to your Censure: Only one thing I would say more, which is this: I would not have you esteem it the less, because 'tis in Verse; though some Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and others that could never attain to it, dare vilifie and prophane Poetry (which the best and wisest of all Ages always held Sacred and Divine) as if it were uncapable, or at least unfit, to express any thing of weight or moment. But Antiquity gives sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the contrary, and therefore I shall let them alone in their Folly, and bid thee heartily</p>

                  <l>To our harsh yoak, the Northern Islands King.</l>
                  <l>The Church he owns, and duty duely pays,</l>

                  <l>Dull in acknowledgment his senses are,</l>

                  <l>This makes our Coffers from that Island come</l>

                  <l>He paus'd, and all the holy Tribe were mute:</l>
                  <l>Then starts again, and with a formal look,</l>
                  <l>(As full of deep Enigma's as his Book)</l>
                  <l>He call'd th'Apostate Angel by his name,</l>
                  <l>Who drew the vail, and to his presence came;</l>
                  <l>Haste, says this dark contriver, fly from hence,</l>
                  <l>Dress all your looks in Sacred Innocence;</l>
                  <l>Assume the garb of our Religious Sire,</l>
                  <l>And to the Northern Isle with hast retire;</l>
                  <l>There ere its stubborn Monarch wake from sleep,</l>
                  <l>In visionary form before him sweep:</l>
                  <l>Sue, beg, intreat, fall prostrate at his feet,</l>
                  <l>With all your guiles his slumbring fancy greet;</l>
                  <l>Preach Dispensations, Pardons, all the throng</l>
                  <l>Of holy Cheats, that to great <hi>Rome</hi> belong;</l>
                  <l>Promise him all your Holiness can do,</l>

                  <l>The Devil bow'd soon as the words were spoke,</l>
                  <l>He clap'd his wings, and vanish'd thence in smoke,</l>

                  <l>See 'em suspended, and at once look pale,</l>

                  <l>That for some secret reason he should bleed?</l>
                  <l>Yet he curs'd <hi>Cain,</hi> who presently was driv'n,</l>
                  <l>And made a vagabond on Earth and Heav'n;</l>
                  <l>A secret mark was on the Murth'rer set,</l>

               <l>And dash'd their Treasons ere it was too late;</l>
               <l>Did in our Monarch's stead the Traytors harm,</l>
               <l>And with one stroak broke all their mighty Charm:</l>
               <l>Brought the Conspirators and Friends of <hi>Rome</hi>
               </l>
               <l>T'eternal Exile, and eternal Doom:</l>
               <l>Brought 'em to shame in the Catastrophe,</l>
               <l>As he will all that strike at Monarchy.</l>
               <l>Heav'n that reserv'd this happiness in store,</l>
               <l>Gave us not this, to give us then no more;</l>
               <l>Fed us not once with universal Joy,</l>
               <l>To curse us soon, and quickly to destroy:</l>
               <l>For bliss thus giv'n, and snatch'd away in haste,</l>
               <l>The Pain is greater for the Pleasure past.</l>
               <l>To be Repriev'd, and to prolong our Breath,</l>
               <l>Only to plague us by a lingring Death,</l>
               <l>Is past the burthen of that man to bear,</l>
               <l>Who hourly is distracted with his fear.</l>
               <l>Therefore till Heav'n our Reasons do direct</l>
               <l>To lop those Cedars down it did detect;</l>
               <l>With Pannick Fear and strange Convulsions we</l>
               <l>Must still expect the <hi>Romish</hi> Tyranny,</l>
               <l>Unless well guarded by Divinity.</l>
